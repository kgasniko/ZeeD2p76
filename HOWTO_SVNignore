To ignore files/folders do the following

1. goto a directory where you want to ignore the files

2. create list of the files to be ignored
for example, use
svn status | grep "^\?" | awk "{print \$2}" > ignoring.txt

3. say to SVN that you want to ignore the files from the list
svn propset svn:ignore -F ignoring.txt .

be aware of the fact, that this action re-writes (_not_ add!) the previous
ignore setup, so put _all_ the files to be ignored to the ignore list

4. commit the action
svn ci -m "change ignore list" .
